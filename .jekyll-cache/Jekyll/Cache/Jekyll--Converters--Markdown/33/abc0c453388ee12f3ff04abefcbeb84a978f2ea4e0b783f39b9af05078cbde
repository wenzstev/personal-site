I"º<p>As you may have noticed, things look a bit different around here, and itâ€™s a long time coming. <!--more--></p>

<p>When I first began to blog I knew very little about web development and didnâ€™t want to interrupt my Python work to learn. So I picked a layout someone else had made and called it a day. And for the past 11 (!) months Iâ€™ve been hammering away at it.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s been a stalwart companion on my journey to learn software development, from my shaky <a href="/2020/01/17/Recipe-Parser-Part-1.html">command line days</a> to my <a href="/2020/02/10/Grocery-App-Pt-1.html">first stab at a web app</a>, <a href="/2020/05/30/Calculator-Part-1.html">discovery of React</a>, and more comprehensive work on a <a href="/2020/07/16/Grocery-App-Frontend-1.html">frontend and backend structure</a>. Iâ€™ve talked about my <a href="/2020/09/12/Its-Out.html">successes</a> and my <a href="/2020/04/24/That-Was-Hard.html">failures</a>, and Iâ€™m glad to have it as a record.</p>

<p>But the blog was shaky and it didnâ€™t really feel like mine. As part of my current push to consolidate my online presence, a rework was necessary. Here are a few things I learned in the process.</p>

<h3 id="1-pick-the-right-tools-for-the-job">1. Pick the Right Tools for the Job</h3>

<p>Now, I know what youâ€™re thinking: â€œSteve, didnâ€™t you just build a portfolio site?â€ And youâ€™re right. I did. <a href="/2020/10/03/Update-Post.html">You can read about it here</a>.</p>

<p>But it wasnâ€™t very good. I was determined to prove that I was a Real Web Developer who Knew His Stuff, and I threw in so many bells and whistles that the whole thing started to look like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_Brother,_Where_Art_Thou%3F">the car Homer Simpson designed that put his brother out of business</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/the-homer-inline4.jpg" alt="Homer's disasterous car" /></p>

<p>Relevant information was difficult to find and organization was nonexistent. The whole thing was built in React with Material-UI, totally unnecessary for what should be a static site. I didnâ€™t even use Gatsby.</p>

<p>This site, on the other hand, is built with 100% grass-fed HTML and CSS, with a little sprinkle of JavaScript for pizzazz. It loads much faster, is much leaner, and tells an overall better story of who I am and what I can do.</p>

<p>Youâ€™ve always got to pick the right tools for the job. Donâ€™t use a Cadillac to haul freight, and donâ€™t use an SPA framework to build a static site.</p>

<h3 id="2-vanilla-javascript-can-be-fun">2. Vanilla JavaScript can be Fun</h3>

<p>Wait, where are you going? Stick with me for two seconds, Iâ€™ll be quick, I promise.</p>

<p>But not as quick as vanilla JavaScript! <a href="https://gomakethings.com/just-how-much-faster-is-vanilla-js-than-frameworks/">Itâ€™s a lean, mean, performant machine.</a> Itâ€™s also much faster on the setup. No compiler, no bundler, just you and a text editor and a dream.</p>

<p>Of course there are many, many issues with vanilla JavaScript. Everything can take so long and writing a million <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">document.getElementById()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">appendTextNode()</code> can be a huge pain in the ass.</p>

<p>But thereâ€™s a simplicity to it thatâ€™s hard to match, and thereâ€™s something very satisfying for me about just opening a text document, writing a few lines of code, and having it <em>do something.</em></p>

<h3 id="3-dont-be-afraid-to-start-from-nothing">3. Donâ€™t be afraid to start from nothing</h3>

<p>My first attempt at restarting this blog featured the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/">Jekyll quick start</a>, but I soon found I didnâ€™t like it. It included a lot of stuff I didnâ€™t want or need. So I ended up wiping it and truly <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/">starting from scratch</a>, with nothing but Gemfile and index.html.</p>

<p>It was a bit more work, but the end result feels like <em>mine</em> in a way that using the quick start doesnâ€™t. I had complete control over how all of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was implemented, and I drew a craftsmanâ€™s satisfaction from that.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s like the difference between buying a table kit and visiting the lumber yard. Sometimes you just want to cut the boards yourself.</p>

<h3 id="4-how-you-present-your-blog-content-matters">4. How You Present your blog content Matters</h3>

<p>You may have noticed this post is a bit different than what I normally write. Thatâ€™s because Iâ€™m trying to get with the picture. Over the course of moving my old posts over to the new site, I did a bit of reading on what makes for engaging blog content. Spoiler alert: itâ€™s not my stuff.</p>

<p>My previous posts have been loaded down with huge paragraphs and bloated explanations that were difficult to read; even my own eyes just slide over them.</p>

<p>So Iâ€™m limiting the size of my paragraphs to make them easier to read. I also added larger margins around the text for desktop, simulating a mobile experience.</p>

<h3 id="5-your-actual-blog-content-matters-too">5. Your actual blog content matters, too</h3>

<p>This blog has served as a technical diary of my work, and to that end I think itâ€™s been decent. But itâ€™s done nothing to showcase my writing abilities. I mean, Iâ€™m supposed to be an English major here.</p>

<p>Partly thatâ€™s because Iâ€™ve tried to spend as little time writing as possible so I could get back to coding, but itâ€™s also just because I didnâ€™t really know what to write. And, well, I still donâ€™t, but I think this might be a better direction to go in.</p>

<p>Talking about what Iâ€™ve learned, how I market myself, how I stick to a regular coding routine, all feel more productive and interesting than just writing about my latest implementation of a <a href="/2020/05/04/Schemas-Part-1.html">Flask backend</a>. Not that I donâ€™t want to write about what Iâ€™m coding, but Iâ€™m going to try to limit that a bit more and flesh out other of writing.</p>

<p>I still donâ€™t really know what I want this blog to be and where I want it to go, but itâ€™s been a long neglected aspect of my online presence, and I want to take some steps to change that. This feels like a good start.</p>
