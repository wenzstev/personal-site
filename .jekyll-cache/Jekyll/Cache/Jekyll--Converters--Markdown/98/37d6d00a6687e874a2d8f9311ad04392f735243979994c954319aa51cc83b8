I"L<p>It‚Äôs time for a bit of a pivot. <!--more--></p>

<p>Since I first began full stack web development, I have stuck with my trusty Flask backend. It‚Äôs a legacy from a younger, more bright-eyed Steve who picked up a copy of <em>Automating the Boring Stuff with Python</em> over a year ago after hearing Reddit sing its praises. My journey into web development grew organically from that, first into Jinja templating and later into a proper split between front and back ends.</p>

<p>Now, I‚Äôm leaving the safe harbor of Flask for new ports.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been interested in the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mern-stack/">MERN stack</a> for a while now; not least which because I‚Äôve been working in a big part of it (React and NodeJS) for a while. Some of my JavaScript tutorials had briefly touched on Express, and I‚Äôve been curious about NoSQL databases ever since I learned the difference between them.</p>

<p>Over the last few days, I‚Äôve been playing with a new MERN ecosystem and have been delighted at how simple it is to spin off a small backend. Honestly, it‚Äôs a much better stack for my <a href="/2020/10/06/Anomaly-Finder-Backend.html">last project</a>, where the backend was basically an empty bucket where I stored little pieces of information. Flask (and Python more generally) is better suited for SousChef, because I acuatlly need to do some processing of the data, and Python is much more suited for that. But for now, I‚Äôm going to make MERN my go-to stack, at least until I‚Äôm comfortable with it.</p>

<p>Which leads me to my new project. Enter‚Ä¶</p>

<h3 id="jobhound">JobHound</h3>

<p>Do you hate the job search? I know I do. Modern websites have made the task of job hunting both easier and harder than ever before. Easier, because you can save your resume and find jobs that match your qualifications faster than ever before. Harder, because everyone else does it too (and because those algorithms aren‚Äôt always <em>that</em> good at matching).</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been in the midst of a job search myself, and over the course of the last few months, all of the little annoyances of the hunt have begun to accumulate for me. Stuff like drafting your cover letter, keepign track of which resume you‚Äôre using for what applications, trying to find personalized company values to demonstrate that you‚Äôve looked at their website and you want to work for <em>them specifically</em> (whether or not you actually do), filling in your information even though it‚Äôs already on your resume, when and how to follow up‚Ä¶</p>

<p>It sucks. And while there are websites out there that streamline the process, they generally only do so for their specific website, meaning you have to juggle between numerous different places to keep track of everything.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs where JobHound (working title) comes in. My plan is to create a central app that stores and tracks all of my different job applications, where I applied, the websites I‚Äôm using, what cover letter I used, and so on. My hope is to find trends for what works and what doesn‚Äôt, and create some sense of progression in what is ultimately a cyclical process.</p>

<p>Additionally, I‚Äôm going to be doing things a bit differently this time around. I‚Äôve <a href="http://jobhound.stevenwenzel.com">already got the empty app up and running</a>, and I‚Äôm going to be updating it in real time as I work. My goal is to get some small feature or asset implemented every day, in the same vein of those <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code">‚ÄúX days of code‚Äù</a> challenges that go around the internet from time to time.</p>
