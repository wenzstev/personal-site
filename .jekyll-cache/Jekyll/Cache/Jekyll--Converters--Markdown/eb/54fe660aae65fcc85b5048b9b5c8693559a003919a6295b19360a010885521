I"½	<p>So itâ€™s been a little while since I wrote a blog post, and I figured it was time to make a little note of what Iâ€™ve been up to. Long story short, Iâ€™ve been spending my time learning Flask through a fantastic tutorial series by Corey Schafer. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo&amp;list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH">Python Flask Tutorial</a> has done an absolutely fantastic job at introducing me to the basics of web app design, and Iâ€™ve been enjoying going through the process with his examples.</p>

<p>Why am I learning Flask, you may ask? Excellent question, and the long and short of it is that Iâ€™ve decided to build a web app to host the trained ingredient NER model that Iâ€™ve been developing, and turn my little project into a proper flagship portfolio piece. My goal is to have a simple app that allows users to provide recipe urls, extracts the ingredients from them, and consolidates them into a single grocery list, essentially the same as what my original command line application would do.</p>

<p>To that end, Iâ€™ve been learning Flask. I wasnâ€™t sure at first if I wanted to build this app with Django or Flask, but I chose the latter because it is simpler and has a less involved startup process. Iâ€™m still not convinced how involved I want to make the app, but Iâ€™m thinking basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a> functionality. I would like for users to be able to share their grocery lists, and for lists to be saved and edited later. Additionally, I would like to make it as easy as possible for a user to correct any errors that the spaCy model cooks up; itâ€™s unlikely that itâ€™s going to read the ingredients 100 % of the time, and I want it to be easy to adjust ingredient lines as necessary. I would also like to offer the choice to combine like ingredients. Ideally, this would be a quick app that takes about five minutes to consolidate all recipes, then you can print it and youâ€™re ready to go.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t have much else to say at the moment, but Iâ€™ll be blogging my progress on the Flask app as I go. I chose not to blog the tutorial series I was learning from, mainly because the app I created is exactly the same as the tutorial and I felt like my time was better spent learning. But now that Iâ€™m back to building my own stuff (at least for now), expect more frequent blog posts again.</p>

<p>And with that, Iâ€™m off to code. Catch you later.</p>
