I"æ	<p>Itâ€™s time for a bit of a pivot. <!--more--></p>

<p>Since I first began full stack web development, I have stuck with my trusty Flask backend. Itâ€™s a legacy from a younger, more bright-eyed Steve who picked up a copy of <em>Automating the Boring Stuff with Python</em> over a year ago after hearing Reddit sing its praises. My journey into web development grew organically from that, first into Jinja templating and later into a proper split between front and back ends.</p>

<p>Now, Iâ€™m leaving the safe harbor of Flask for new ports.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been interested in the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mern-stack/">MERN stack</a> for a while now; not least which because Iâ€™ve been working in a big part of it (React and NodeJS) for a while. Some of my JavaScript tutorials had briefly touched on Express, and Iâ€™ve been curious about NoSQL databases ever since I learned the difference between them.</p>

<p>Over the last few days, Iâ€™ve been playing with a new MERN ecosystem and have been delighted at how simple it is to spin off a small backend. Honestly, itâ€™s a much better stack for my <a href="/2020/10/06/Anomaly-Finder-Backend.html">last project</a>, where the backend was basically an empty bucket where I stored little pieces of information. Flask (and Python more generally) is better suited for SousChef, because I acuatlly need to do some processing of the data, and Python is much more suited for that. But from now on, Iâ€™m going to make MERN my go-to stack for small backends, at least until Iâ€™m comfortable with it.</p>

<p>Which leads me to my new project. Enterâ€¦</p>

<p>Do you hate the job search? I know I do. Modern websites have made the task of job hunting both easier and harder than ever before. Easier, because you can save your resume and find jobs that match your qualifications faster than ever before. Harder, because everyone else does it too (and because those algorithms arenâ€™t always <em>that</em> good at matching).</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been in the midst of a job search myself, and over the course of the last few months, all of the little annoyances of the hunt have begun to accumulate for me. Stuff like drafting your cover letter, keepign track of which resume youâ€™re using for what applications, trying to find personalized company values to demonstrate that youâ€™ve looked at their website and you want to work for <em>them specifically</em> (whether or not you actually do), when and how to follow upâ€¦</p>

<p>It sucks.</p>
