I"ò<p>Itâ€™s time for a bit of a pivot. <!--more--></p>

<p>Since I first began full stack web development, I have stuck with my trusty Flask backend. Itâ€™s a legacy from a younger, more bright-eyed Steve who picked up a copy of <em>Automating the Boring Stuff with Python</em> over a year ago after hearing Reddit sing its praises. My journey into web development grew organically from that, first into Jinja templating and later into a proper split between front and back ends.</p>

<p>Now, for the first time, Iâ€™m branching out.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been interested in the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mern-stack/">MERN stack</a> for a while now; not least which because Iâ€™ve been working in a big part of it (React and NodeJS) for a while.</p>
