I"I<p>It’s time for a bit of a pivot. <!--more--></p>

<p>Since I first began full stack web development, I have stuck with my trusty Flask backend. It’s a legacy from a younger, more bright-eyed Steve who picked up a copy of <em>Automating the Boring Stuff with Python</em> over a year ago after hearing Reddit sing its praises. My journey into web development grew organically from that, first into Jinja templating and later into a proper split between front and back ends.</p>

<p>Now, I’m leaving the safe harbor of Flask for new ports.</p>

<p>I’ve been interested in the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mern-stack/">MERN stack</a> for a while now; not least which because I’ve been working in a big part of it (React and NodeJS) for a while. Some of my JavaScript tutorials had briefly touched on Express, and I’ve been curious about NoSQL databases ever since I learned the difference between them.</p>

<p>Over the last few days, I’ve been playing with a new MERN ecosystem and have been delighted at how simple it is to spin off a small backend. Honestly, it’s a much better stack for my <a href="/2020/10/06/Anomaly-Finder-Backend.html">last project</a>, where the backend was basically an empty bucket where I stored little pieces of information. Flask (and Python more generally) is better suited for SousChef, because I acuatlly need to do some processing of the data, and Python is much more suited for that. But from now on, I’m going to make MERN my go-to stack for small backends, at least until I’m comfortable with it.</p>

<p>Which leads me to my new project.</p>
