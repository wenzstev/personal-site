I"å<p>Itâ€™s time for a bit of a pivot. <!--more--></p>

<p>Since I first began full stack web development, I have stuck with my trusty Flask backend. Itâ€™s a legacy from a younger, more bright-eyed Steve who picked up a copy of <em>Automating the Boring Stuff with Python</em> over a year ago after hearing Reddit sing itâ€™s praises. My journey into web development grew organically from that, first into Jinja Templating and later into a proper split between front and back ends.</p>
