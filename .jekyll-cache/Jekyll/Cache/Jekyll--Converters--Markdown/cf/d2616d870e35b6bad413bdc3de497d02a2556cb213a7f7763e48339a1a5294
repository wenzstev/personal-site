I"Ú <p>Time to bring our baby into the cold, cruel world. <!--more--></p>

<p>In <a href="/2020/12/12/How-To-Deploy-Simple-Mern.html">Part 1</a> of this tutorial, we learned how to set up a simple React frontend and Express backend. Now, in Part 2, we‚Äôll learn how to host it. There are many, many ways to do this, but for today I‚Äôm going to be using <a href="https://digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a>.</p>

<p>DigitalOcean has a ton of extremely good tutorials, and I‚Äôm going to be using <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-node-js-application-for-production-on-ubuntu-16-04">this one</a> as the backbone for this tutorial. It‚Äôs good but only covers the backend, and there are a few changes that we‚Äôll need to make in order for both the front and back ends to be called from the same resource.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-getting-your-application-on-github">Step 1: Getting Your Application on GitHub</h3>

<p>In order to transfer the application to your droplet, we‚Äôre going to use Git, specifically GitHub. If you‚Äôve never used GitHub before, you can <a href="https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&amp;ref_loc=header+logged+out&amp;ref_page=%2F&amp;source=header-home">sign up here</a>. This isn‚Äôt a Git tutorial, but if you‚Äôve never used the program before, you can check out some handy instructional material <a href="https://try.github.io/">here</a>. For now, we‚Äôre going to assume you have a GitHub account, and take it from there.</p>

<p>Log in to your account and select the ‚ÄúNew‚Äù button by the Repositories list, on the upper left side of the screen.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/mern/new-repo.png" alt="Picture of Github home page. The green &quot;New&quot; button is highlighted in red." /></p>

<p>On the next page, name your new repo whatever you like, and provide a description if you want. Make sure that you do NOT provide a README or .gitignore. We‚Äôre going to take care of them ourselves.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/mern/new-repo-2.png" alt="Picture of the &quot;new repository&quot; page, along with instructions that mirror the ones in the previous paragraph." /></p>

<p>Click ‚ÄúCreate repository‚Äù and you should now be on the main page for your brand new repo!</p>

<p>We‚Äôre going to be following the instructions there, but first you need to make a few changes to our actual project. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">create-react-app</code> function creates it‚Äôs own git repository, and we‚Äôre going to need to get rid of it in order to make sure everything goes smoothly.</p>

<p>In your file explorer, navigate to the ‚Äúclient‚Äù folder that was created when you ran <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">create-react-app</code>. Depending on your settings, you should either see a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.git</code> file or not. If you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôll need to show hidden files. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/view-hidden-files-and-folders-in-windows-10-97fbc472-c603-9d90-91d0-1166d1d9f4b5#:~:text=Open%20File%20Explorer%20from%20the,folders%2C%20and%20drives%20and%20OK.">Here‚Äôs how to do it on Windows</a></p>

<p>When you‚Äôve found the .git file, just delete it. That‚Äôs all you need to do to get rid of the repo there.</p>

<p>You should also see a ‚Äú.gitignore‚Äù file. Rather than delete it, we‚Äôre going to move it up a folder and modify it to be our own gitignore.</p>

<p>Move the file up into your main project folder, and alter it so that it reads as follows:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-escape" data-lang="escape"># See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/ for more about ignoring files.

# dependencies
client/node_modules/
backend/node_modules/
/.pnp
.pnp.js

# testing
/coverage

# production
client/build

# misc
.DS_Store
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local

npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*</code></pre></figure>

<p>The main change we made here is to change the default <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/node_modules/</code> path to work for both the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">client</code> and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">backend</code> folders. Otherwise, we‚Äôd be committing all of our Node packages to the git repository, which would be a huge waste of space.</p>

<p>When you‚Äôre finished, it‚Äôs time to create the actual repo that we‚Äôre going to be using. In your terminal screen, navigate to the main project folder and initialize a new git repository with this command:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="go">git init</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This will create the new repository, and the .gitignore file you modifed will automatically be used for the repository.</p>

<p>Now we‚Äôve created our repo, but we still need to get it on the internet. To do this, return to the main page of the repo you just created. There will be several options for how to populate this repo, and we‚Äôre going to use the second one on the list (‚Äúpush an existing repository from the command line‚Äù).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/mern/push-repo-to-github.png" alt="Page of instructions for how to set up the Github repository. The second optoon on the list, &quot;push an existing repository from the command line&quot; is highlighted." /></p>

<p>The commands you see here are to be done in your main git folder. You should still have it open in your console screen, so enter the commands as you see them in the example above (or in your own repository instructions):</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="go">git remote add origin https://github.com/[your-username]/[repo-name].git
git branch -M main 
git push -u origin main</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In the example above, the bracketed information should be replaced with your particular username and repo name. Using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git branch</code> command creates a new branch in the repository, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git push -u origin main</code> pushes the information in the repository to your new branch.</p>

<p>If everything was done right, you should be able to refresh the page and see your repository information online.</p>

<p>Congragulations! Your app is now hosted on Github, and can be cloned to any machine, phyiscal or otherwise. Now, we need to get it on your droplet.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-upload-your-application-onto-your-droplet">Step 2: Upload your application onto your droplet</h3>

<p>For this step, you will need a DigitalOcean droplet running Ubuntu and a domain name that you control. Getting both is outside the scope of this tutorial, but you can use <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/create/">this</a> tutorial as a guide for how to set it up. When you‚Äôve finished doing so, come back here and pick up where you left off.</p>

<p>‚Ä¶finished? Excellent. Now that you‚Äôve got your droplet, let‚Äôs get your repo on it.</p>

<p>First, make sure that git is installed on your machine.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="go">sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git </span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Then, navigate to the folder that you want your repo to be installed on. I generally use my home folder. From there, you need to clone your repository into the folder. You can do this using the command</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="go">git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/[repo-name].git</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This will download the contents of the above repository into a new folder in your chosen directory. Congradulations! Your application is now uploaded into your droplet. Now it‚Äôs time to deploy it.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-deploy-your-application">Step 3: Deploy your Application</h3>

<p>This is actually two distinct steps: deploying the backend and deploying the frontend. Since they are split, we‚Äôll have to do them separately, but don‚Äôt worry, the process isn‚Äôt complicated.</p>

<p>In order to deploy the backend, we‚Äôre going to be using</p>
