I"<p>Looking in my backlog of posts, it appears that I made an update post only two posts ago, only to vanish again without warning. <!--more--> This time, I have a pretty good reason: I was interviewing for a job. It was a dream position for me: a great company, an ideal start to my software dev career, and the light at the end of this long tunnel of self-directed work that I’ve been going down for almost a year now. The interview process was long and pretty involved and while I did well at first, ultimately the position I was interviewing for was too senior for my experience level, and they felt that there were still some areas where I needed to improve.</p>

<p>So I’m back. And I can’t lie, this one hurts. I put my projects on hold to study for this, and I put a ton of hours into it over the last few weeks. To have put that much work in, and still come up short… it’s not a good feeling, and certainly a blow to the ego. But at the end of the day, there’s nothing to do but keep going, and remind myself, again and again:</p>

<p>This is not an easy task. While there are some coding savants out there, for most people it’s hard as hell to learn this stuff, to teach it to yourself well enough to get a job. I have been slogging through this for 2-4 hours a day nearly every day since January, and I’m still not there. I think that some of that was not great use of my time, but at the end of the day there’s a <em>ton</em> to learn and it takes a long time to learn it all.</p>

<p>And yeah this was a blow, but I’m still here. I’ve still got the crappy laptop I’ve been using this whole time. I’ve still got my brains. And I’ve still got the love of coding that has kept me going for this long. I’ll get there. And it will feel all the better when I finally do.</p>
