I"Ù<p>Itâ€™s been a busy November here in the coding mines. <!--more--> In keeping with my new philosophy of blogging, Iâ€™m trying to post less frequently and focus more on actually getting new projects and apps out the door. But Iâ€™ve got a couple of new things out now, and Iâ€™m pretty excited about them.</p>

<h3 id="anomaly-finder-frontend">Anomaly Finder Frontend</h3>

<p>Yes, the Anomaly Finder frontend is finished, and the project is hosted! You can check it out <a href="https://anomalies.stevenwenzel.com/">here</a>. I had some fun with the introduction; itâ€™s the first time Iâ€™ve tried any kind of digital storytelling and I wanted something to set the scene. Overall Iâ€™m quite pleased with how it came out; it really makes me wish that I had learned about Styled Components earlier. They would have worked much better for my other projects, and I think Iâ€™ll be using them much more in my future React projects.</p>

<p>As it stands, you can enter anomalies and browse through ones that others have already entered. I have a very simple save and voting system that is implemented through the browserâ€™s local storage (at some point I may devote a future blog post to integrating local storage and React). This is really the most simple, barebones implementation of this concept that I could come up with right now, but Iâ€™m still pleased with where it is. In the future, I would love to come back to this and expand it into a proper collaborative storytelling project.</p>

<h3 id="souschef-demo">SousChef Demo</h3>

<p>As for the other piece of news, I have modified <a href="https://souschef.stevenwenzel.com">SousChef</a> to allow some features to be used outside of the register wall. In retrospect, it was a <em>huge</em> mistake to lock the project that Iâ€™ve worked the hardest on and am the most proud of behind an email sign up. I wanted to prove that I could do it, but in practice it just means that no one is going to see it. So these modifications are my first step in fixing that.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the project was built from the ground up with user accounts in mind, and so stripping them away is going to take a while (not to mention Iâ€™m deleting monthsâ€™ worth of workâ€¦ lesson learned). But for now Iâ€™ve essentially added a backdoor into the recipe parser, so that people can submit recipes for parsing without needing an account. Currently an account is still needed to build a grocery list, but making the necessary changes in that department is going to take a while. Iâ€™m going to be switching back and forth from working on this project to working on other things, because to be honest Iâ€™m kind of sick of working on this project. But Iâ€™ve got a lot of ideas for a what a third version of this project would look like, and if I ever get the energy to revamp it, I think I could make it pretty damn good.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, enjoy the modifications Iâ€™ve made, and stay tuned as Iâ€™ve got a lot if interesting stuff coming down the pipe!</p>

<p>Steve</p>
