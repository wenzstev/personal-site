... well, okay, it's not done yet. But the damn thing is online, and at this point, that's all I care about. This has been a very frustrating few days, but also a very educational one. I got a crash course in how to host a server on Linux with uWSGI and Nginx and, more broadly, a crash course in Linux itself. Not something I've used much before.

I'm using DigitalOcean for hosting and my own name as the domain (I bought it a few years back because why not). My eventual plan is to have several different portfolio projects linking off of the website, with this blog (or its descendent) as the main site. There's still a ton of work before I get there, but this still feels like a big victory.

This weekend, I'm going to go back through and add in some features that will make it more than just a proof of concept, and maybe then I can stop to take a breather and figure out where I'm at.
