<div class="margin">
<p>And now, the moment we’ve all been waiting for. It’s time to see if spaCy can learn what an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INGREDIENT</code> is.</p>

<p>My first step was to use the program I’d made from my <a href="/2020/01/27/Annotating-Large-Amounts-of-Data.html">previous post</a> and use it to annotate the rest of my recipe lines. And I’m pleased to say that it worked, for the most part. There were a few errors that I’d like to iron out, but the process was quick and relatively painless.</p>

<p>Okay, it was still annoying, but I don’t think there’s really any way around that. I timed myself, and it took me roughly 8 minutes to annotate all ingredients, and about half that time for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CARDINAL</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QUANTITY</code> classes (because there were less of them). Taken together, that made 100 lines of annotated data in about 20 minutes of work. Not bad.</p>

<p>Then it was time for training. I again took the code from spaCy’s example documentation. It’s largely the same as the example for updating a new entity class, with a few minor changes such as adding the additional entity. But the basic loop is still the same: batch up a group of examples, have the model guess what they are, compare that to the annotations, adjust weights accordingly.</p>

<p>I had a few false starts, because some of the labelled entities were overlapping. This was an easy enough to fix by hand, but I made a note to write something later to do this automatically.</p>

<p>After a while…</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/ner_ingredient/its-working.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>It’s training! I left it alone for a few minutes and…</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/ner_ingredient/successful-entity-parse.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>It worked! At least for this example. So far so good. Now I needed a new way to test it, so I needed to create additional data. This was something I’ve been meaning to do for a while now anyway. I went back and modified my original script for generating recipe lines so it would do so randomly:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">random_ingredients</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'recipes_raw_nosource_epi.json'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">recipes_raw</span><span class="p">:</span>

        <span class="n">rand_recipe</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">random</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">choice</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">list</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">items</span><span class="p">()))</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">rand_recipe</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="s">'ingredients'</span><span class="p">]</span>


<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">generate_ingredient_dataset</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">length</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
    <span class="n">ingredient_list</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>

    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ingredient_list</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">length</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">current_ingredients</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">random_ingredients</span><span class="p">()</span>
        <span class="n">ingredient_list</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">extend</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">current_ingredients</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">ingredient_list</span><span class="p">[:</span><span class="n">length</span><span class="p">]</span>  <span class="c1"># there will probably be a few extras; clamp them</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This is slow to execute because there are a <em>lot</em> of recipes that need to be added to this list. At the moment, though, I’m willing to overlook it because I’m not going to need to do this very much. If I need to make these randomized lists more regularly, I might need to figure out a faster way to do this.</p>

<p>But it works:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/ner_ingredient/second-dataset.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>I then began annotating the data. It took about the same amount of time as my previous work, with a little extra because I very foolishly forgot to change the annotation tag a few times, meaning I labelled everything <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CARDINAL</code> and had to go back. When I was done beating my head against the wall, I corrected my mistake, ran it again, and it worked.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/ner_ingredient/annotation-complete.png" alt="alt text" title="Beautiful, beautiful test data" /></p>

<p>One thing I’m realizing is that I should maybe add an additional category for comments because otherwise extremely similar ingredients are going to be read differently. Alternately, I could add adjectives as ingredients. Maybe there’s no need to reinvent the wheel here.</p>

<p>I then wrote some code to compare the model’s performance with the annotated data:</p>

<p>For every line in the test, the ingredient model evaluates what it thinks the entities are. It then compares them to the actual examples to see if it got them right. The ultimate results are printed at the end. And what are those results?</p>

<p><em>…drumroll please…</em></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/ner_ingredient/success_rates.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Well, it’s not <em>terrible.</em></p>

<p>It makes sense that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QUANTITY</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CARDINAL</code> did much better, because both of them were already existing categories, and spaCy’s documentation notes that NER will need fewer examples of already existing categories to improve them. I’m not sure what to account for the difference between the two, however.</p>

<p>As for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INGREDIENT</code>, well I’m going to say that it’s still too early to tell. After all, this is only 100 examples, and I’m going to try to triple that amount or more. It will be interesting to see how the model improves with more examples.</p>

<p>To get a better idea of what sorts of errors it was getting, I added a quick line to print out the ingredient if it did not match correctly. The results were… unexpected.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/ner_ingredient/nutmeg.png" alt="nutmeg" /></p>

<p>Hmm, that seems… accurate. I checked my annotations and realized that I had marked the ingredient as “ground nutmeg.” A technically incorrect result, but one that any human would have no trouble understanding. Let’s look at another “error.”</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/ner_ingredient/olive-oil.png" alt="olive oil" /></p>

<p>Another one that seems like it should be right at first glance. I checked and realized that I had annotated it as “extra-virgin olive oil.” Again, the program marked it as technically incorrect when the meaning was right. (Various culinary minds may remark here on the importance of “extra-virgin” to an olive oil. I leave them to this very important task.)</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/ner_ingredient/thyme_sprigs.png" alt="thyme sprigs" /></p>

<p><em>This</em> one was annoying, because I realized that I had just marked “thyme” as the ingredient. But why had I not marked “thyme sprigs” as the ingredient, when I added modifiers to <em>extra-virgin</em> olive oil and <em>ground</em> nutmeg?</p>

<p>At this point, I was beginning to see that I had a problem. The entity recognizer was performing better than I had expected, and its failures were due in part to an inconsistent style of labelling done by yours truly. I’m realizing now that I have no central philosophy behind what defines an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INGREDIENT</code> versus what would be considered a modifier or an adjective to said ingredient.</p>

<p>But at the same time, this is a more complicated problem than it first might appear. Take sugar as an example. I wouldn’t necessarily want my program to group all kinds of sugar together; there are too many different kinds, and a recipe that calls for “brown sugar” won’t be the same if “white sugar” is recorded. At the same time, “white sugar” is often written as just “sugar” or even “granulated sugar.” On the other hand, a user of this program will see “sugar” and assume white sugar, so maybe it’s best to just record “sugar” unless it’s “brown sugar.” On the <em>other</em> other hand….</p>

<p>And so we go. I’ve been pushing foward with the project valiantly for a while now, but I think it’s time for me to take a step back and take stock of what I’ve done and how I want to move forward. Initial results have been incredibly encouraging, but if I want this to be something that other people will use (and I hope it would be), then I’m going to have to be more specific and thoughtful about how I train these models to store information. I need, essentially, some guiding philosophy to the whole enterprise. So that’s my next step: codify everything that I’ve been doing so far, and everywhere I want to go, and chart a course in that direction.</p>

<p>Plus, I need to look more closely at spaCy’s documentation. I’ve got a nagging feeling that some of the things I’ve been doing here have built-in functions for their use and that I may be reinventing the wheel a bit….</p>
